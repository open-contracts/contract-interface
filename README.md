# [dapp.opencontracts.io](https://dapp.opencontracts.io)
The OpenContracts Dapp, automatically generated for any Open Contract.
The client protocol logic is isolated inito https://github.com/open-contracts/client-protocol and could be used by other frontends as well. We might release it as a well-documented package once things are more stable. But why worry about creating a custom interface when you don't have to? :)

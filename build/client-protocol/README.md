# client-protocol
Think of it as a self-contained package that's used by https://github.com/open-contracts/open-contracts.github.io to create https://dapp.opencontracts.io, the generalized open contracts interface. This repo isolates the client protocol logic. You can also use it to create custom frontends for your Open Contract, [but you shouldn't](https://github.com/open-contracts/open-contracts.github.io/blob/main/README.md).
